# Programming
Tiny habits, remarkable results! 
Solving one programming problem everyday
## Problem 1

- Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:
- shorten(url), which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric string, such as zLg6wl.
- restore(short), which expands the shortened string into the original url. If no such shortened string exists, return null.
Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?

## Problem 2

- Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

- For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.

- Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?

## Problem 3

- Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and calls f after n milliseconds.

## Problem 4

- Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.
- For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].
- Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.

## Problem 5

- There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. 
- The order of the steps matters.For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:
1, 1, 1, 1
2, 1, 1
1, 2, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2
- What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.

## Problem 6

- Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.
For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb".
