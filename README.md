Solving a programming problem everyday
## Problem 1

- Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:
- shorten(url), which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric string, such as zLg6wl.
- restore(short), which expands the shortened string into the original url. If no such shortened string exists, return null.
Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?

## Problem 2

- Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

- For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.

- Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?

## Problem 3

- Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and calls f after n milliseconds.
